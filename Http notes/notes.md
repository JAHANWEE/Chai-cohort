### What are jargons?
jargons ==> fancy words
Jargon is also a Jargon 😂

### Fullform of  HTTP?
- Hypertext :text documents that have hyperlinks(eg:wikipedia)
- Transfer :dosto ka transfer hota hai , log aate hai , log jaate hai (zindagi chalti rhti hai)
- Protocol :== Rulebook (eg:Army protocols , bole toh instructions)

### What is HTTP?
Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts.

### Features of the HTTP
    - Human Readable(so that aap niche likhe tariko se padh sake->what goes on when you interact with a website
		 1. network tab 
		 2. page source  
		 3. inspect element
	- Stateless(does not maintain its state(bole toh  checkpoint , bookmark) 
	- Session(Stored state between Frontend and Backend) is stored in form of Cookie(information)
	
## What do you mean by stateless?
In HTTP, stateless means that every time you talk to a website, it doesn’t remember what you talked about before. Each time is like starting fresh.

Jab TV remote har baar wahi channel default se shuru karta hai aur yaad nahi rakhta tum pichli baar kya dekh rahe the, voh stateless hai. 

### What is session?
eg:doctor ke saath session hota hai , woh aapki medical history yaad rkhta hai

### HTTP Headers consist of:
1.  client(user ka naam , eg mohan ,ramlal etc)
 2. browser info (safari , brave)--customize my products according to it 
3. date and time
4. cookie to store 

### What are HTTP headers? 
**Are extra tags or instructions** that help browsers and servers communicate more efficiently.

Matlab, HTTP Headers jaise ek birthday card ke details hote hain, jo request ya response ke saath extra information bhejte hain! 😄

Eg : Agar koi banda ios use kr rha toh , aap unse zyada charge kr skte hai same bread ke liye( z@pto controversy guys)
Ads dikhaenge (paisa hi paisa 💸)

### Request -Response Model (just fun tech name for nerds 🤓)
send request in form of HTTP headers to server and receives response from server.
		1. Types of Requests [GET , POST , DELETE]]
		2.Request Code[200 , 404 , 500....]
			- what action to perform  GET POST (these are verb)
			- Where to perform this action (http://www.google.com)(url)
			- was it done or executed successfully? give 200 , 404 etc

controversy jargon ka meaning sabko pta hoga 😂~Piyush Garg

### Response :
-ek gaal pe thappad ka response , dursa gaal - Mahatma Gandhi
 -ek gaal pe thappad , response : gun  - thara bhai xyz

### GET :data dedo bhai(eg : get this website )
Socho tum apne papa ko bolte ho, "Papa, mujhe ek chocolate laa do!"
Yeh bolna jaise ek GET request hai.

### POST : Linkedin , twitter pe post krna
### DELETE :Twitter post delete krna hai

### Response :
403 Forbidden: "Papa ne kaha, tumhe chocolate nahi milegi, aaj diet pe ho!"
200 OK: "Yay! chocolate mil gayi!"

Http (Protocol) - V1, V2, V3 are versions of HTTP - Protocol ke version hai. 

### Features of HTTP 2
HTTP 2 (http2 - http ka version 2)
		1. send 1 request and get 1 response . 
			  ->http 1.1 is used as fallback , backup , substitute for HTTP 2
		2. achievement (to send photos) uses compression
		3. uses multiplexing [Multiplexing: Multiple requests and responses can be sent over a single connection] (sends multiple files )
		4. uses encryption(HTTPS)
			->In AWS , we don't  use https for internal communication, due to high compute cost


### More on  HTTP 
-  http 1.1 is used as fallback , backup , substitute for HTTP 2

### What is HTTP 1.1 imp?
http 1.1 be like tera bhai sambhal lega ~Omkar

### What is Multiplexing?
Ab tum ek hi connection se multiple cheezein ek saath maang sakte ho, jaise chocolate 🍬, toy 🪀, aur game, bina har baar alag se request bheje.

### Importance of encryption
Socho tum apne dost ko chocolate🍬, bhejna chahte ho, lekin tum dono ko pata hona chahiye ki chocolate tumhare doston tak safe aur sahi tareeke se pahuche. Tum dono ek secret code decide karte ho, jaise "only my friend can open this chocolate box"!🧃

### What is AWS?
AWS - Cloud Service by Amazon

### Why AWS does not use https in internal communication?
Ghar ke andar sab safe hai - Khatra toh bahar hota hai

### What is DNS?
DNS  -Server ka address

Jaise tum mummy ke paas apni favourite chocolate ka wrapper le jaate ho taaki mummy yaad rakhe ki tumhe kaunsi chocolate chahiye.

## What is HTTPS?
1. It is a marketing gimmick . It is just HTTP +TLS.
	-HTTPS(Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
    -TLS: A Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate is a digital certificate that protects data sent over the internet. It's also known as an SSL certificate.

### What is TLS?
TLS (Transport Layer Security) ek security protocol hai jo tumhara secret message (ya chocolate recipe) safe aur secure rakhne mein madad karta hai.
Jab tum HTTPS ka use karte ho, toh behind the scenes TLS kaam kar raha hota hai, jo tumhare data ko encrypt karta hai taaki koi aur tumhara message padh na sake.

### What is TLS?
HTTPS mein yeh "secret code" ek SSL certificate hai.

### Why TLS?
HTTPS tumhara safe route hai aur TLS wo lock hai jo tumhare data ko secure rakhta hai jab tum us route se travel karte ho! 😄

### Jargons:
1. User agent(A agent  acts as a client to the server eg:  browser,terminal etc)
2. TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) : for sending data over the network.
3. FTP(File Transfer Protocol):TCP - Instructions for sending files over the network(mp3,mp4,text,csv etc).
4. IP(Internet Protocol) :Assign name to each computer(client)using set of predefined instructions
5. URL(Uniform Resource Location) : a locator for resources gives uniform data everytime
6. DNS(Domain Name System Server) : points to the IP.
7. Header (meta-data): Passes additional info , 
8. Payload : is actual data - email , pass (imp info)
9. Cache: stores the data(temporary storage for data )

### About user agent:
Chrome 🤡 is also a User Agent.

### What is URL(link hi hai yeh,simple.)
URL ek address hai jo tumhe internet ki duniya mein kisi specific jagah tak le jaata hai!

### Where are servers kept?
- Cloud : eg:AWS , Azure etc
- In house : Kept in offices 

### What is DNS? {internet ka contacts}
Matlab, DNS tumhe website ka phone number bataane wala phonebook hai, taaki tum internet par apni desired website tak pahuch sako! 😄
DNS ek phonebook hai jo domain names ko IP addresses se match karta hai.
Socho tumhare paas ek birthday card hai, aur tum us card ke upar likhte ho, 

### What is Payload?
"To: [Friend's Name], From: [Your Name]" aur baaki details jaise date, message, etc.

### What is payload?
Payload tumhara actual gift hai, jo tum server ke saath share karte ho! 😄

### What is cache?
🤑 Cashhh

### VOIP(**Voice Over Internet Protocol**)
VOIP is like calling someone through a **video chat app** (like WhatsApp or Zoom), but instead of video, you're just talking in real time.


What is our goal for next 6 months:
1. Setup TCP connection
2. Exchange TLS certificate
3. send verb(GET , POST etc) + URL + data + more....
4. gets the response back with status with status code and data(img , csv , text)
5. TCP connection is closed.

Feel free to drop suggestions . Will be uploading notes everyday.Happy learning !
